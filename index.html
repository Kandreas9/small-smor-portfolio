						<p>
							My name is Andreas Karydopoulos. I love programming and I, in
							fact, programmed this site myself. Suppose I can get geeky for a
							paragraph. I really like react, deno, laravel, and I also think
							svelte is incredible. I also like skateboarding, so not a complete
							nerd.

					<p>
						These are many of the projects I'm most proud of, and I wish there
						were more.
